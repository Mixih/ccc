# The Experimental Compiler Project

A little repository for fiddling around with optimizing compiler concepts from
the ground up. This is not meant to be production ready in any way, as the big
open source compilers have made this a solved problem.

The toolchain is currently planned to be C++17 (at the very least, maybe C++20)
with a flex-bison frontend (with perhaps a pivot to ANTLR at some point
in the future...).
